# Development Log

## Session 2024-12-13

### Progress Summary

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created GitHub Pages site for project documentation
   - Established basic repository structure

2. **LLaMA Integration**
   - Integrated LLaMA 3.2 Vision through Ollama
   - Developed PDF processing pipeline
   - Created system for extracting structured information from resumes

3. **Architecture Development**
   - Established modular design approach with three core components:
     - pdf_processor.py: Handles PDF to LLaMA processing
     - xml_processor.py: Manages XML extraction and validation
     - graph_processor.py: (Planned) Will handle knowledge graph creation

4. **XML Structure Improvement**
   - Developed detailed XML schema for resume data
   - Created structured prompt for consistent LLaMA output
   - Implemented XML extraction and validation

### Current Status

- Successfully processing PDFs through LLaMA 3.2 Vision
- Extracting structured XML content
- Modular architecture in place

### Next Steps

1. Test improved XML output format with LLaMA
2. Implement graph processor component
3. Create relationships between extracted entities
4. Develop querying capabilities for the knowledge graph

### Technical Decisions

1. **Modular Design**
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Separate processing steps for better maintenance

2. **XML Structure**
   - Hierarchical organization of resume data
   - Consistent tag naming and nesting
   - Structured format for easier parsing

3. **File Organization**
   - Deprecated older versions in separate directory
   - Clear separation of concerns in codebase
   - Maintained documentation of changes

### Open Questions

1. Choice of graph database technology
2. Best approach for relationship extraction
3. Query interface design
